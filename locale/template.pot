"presented with a form to fill in a short text label that this path will "
"bear, after which you can begin placing path markers as you explore. You can "
"also use a blank marker stack on an existing path marker that's already been "
"placed and you'll copy the marker's label and continue the path from that "
"point when laying down new markers from your copied stack."
